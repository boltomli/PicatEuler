## There are plenty of problems on ProjectEuler
https://projecteuler.net/

## With solutions in Picat
http://picat-lang.org/

## By Mr. Hakan Kjellerstrand and Lei Chen

* https://github.com/leichen007/projecteuler

## Then why this repo?
Because I've been solving the problems independently and sometimes use a different approach which are interesting IMO. I'll mainly use Picat programming language with the help of pen and paper.
